# 1. Project Overview
This project analyzes the e-commerence website. 
The company is deciding whether to implement the new webpage or keep the old webpage.
Some say that new page causes more conversion, but other say that old page causes more conversions.
I ran a hypothesis test and regression test to determine the cases.

# 2. Required file/softwares
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Python (Jupiter Notebook)
The files required for this project are:
- ab_test.csv.   Shows every individual who has converted or who has not.
- countries.csv.  Show the conversions for each country.
- Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.  

# 3. Analysis and insights
After running a series of hypothesis testing and regression test we came to conclude that the company should not convert.
